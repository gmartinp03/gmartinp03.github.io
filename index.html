        <p>
          But you can call me Gabe. I am an Aerospace Engineering student at
          Iowa State University, expecting to graduate in December 2024. Since I
          am minoring in Computer Science, I decided to develop my skills by
          trying something new: this website!

                In the Summer of 2022, I supported renewable generation
                operations by reviewing project documentation and data mining
                turbine data for lightning protection system upgrades. I mainly
                used Excel to track serial numbers, dates, and turbine
                information for over 3,000 lightning protection systems and to
                automatically accept/reject reports. I also compiled turbine
                metadata to create standard reference maps for contractor use.

                As a member of the recovery team, I worked on researching and
                manufacturing a parachute ejection system for the SRAD 10k
                Spaceport America Competition. We reworked a reefing box system
                to compare it to the standard two-stage ejection system. After
                deciding the two-stage ejection was more reliable, I helped to
                create a subscale model of our main parachute for wind tunnel
                testing. Eventually, we manufactured the full-scale parachute
                and successfully recovered the rocket at the competition.

                I worked with a team of other Aerospace Majors to create a scale
                model of an Airbus A380 in SolidWorks. I specifically worked on
                the fuselage, undercarriage, horizontal stabilizers, and
                engine/wing connectors. I also added the aircraft livery and
                window details while putting the final assembly together.

                Given the 90's game show theme, Baggage, my team had to create a
                craft capable of stable flight that was under a weight limit,
                met a budget, and represented our theme. The craft was
                constructed from balsa wood and could be attached to a large
                balloon for flight. We built our craft to look like a suitcase,
                the centerpiece in Baggage. It was capable of stable flight and
                movement in all directions with three propellors and a rudder.
