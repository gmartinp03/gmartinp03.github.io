          I am an engineering student in my senior year at Iowa State
          University, graduating in Spring 2025. I am finishing up my
          Bachelor of Science in Aerospace Engineering with a minor in Computer
          Science. This website is to highlight experiences and projects in my
          professional development, throughout which I discovered a passion for software development.
